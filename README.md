# Harker-School-Expert-Systems-2015
Files from exercises from The Harker School's Expert System course. I have written two papers (the two PDFs) that explain the history and the RETE algorithm that runs an expert system. The rest of the files (with extension .clp) contain code from exercises that we completed during the course.

These files should be run with JESS (jessrules.com)
